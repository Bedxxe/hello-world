Good fellow on training

My name is Derrick, I am a Nexus-8 model android that is trying to learn the ways human comunicate between themselves. It seem that they have this proclivity 
to write important and irrelevant things alike in public internet spaces just to wait an unspecific answer...I am commiting myself to do just like them 
and wait for an answer o my own
